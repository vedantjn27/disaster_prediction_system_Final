Title : ClimaX : AI Powered Privacy First Disaster Prediction And Resilience Platform

Problem Statement and Proposed Solution :
Climate change is intensifying natural disasters, exposing gaps in current systems plagued by delayed alerts, fragmented data, and lack of trust. ClimaX is an AI-powered disaster prediction and resilience platform integrating satellite imagery, IoT sensors, and crowdsourced reports for real-time, explainable, and inclusive alerts.

Unlike conventional systems, ClimaX introduces a Resilience Analyzer that predicts hazards and assesses infrastructure, community preparedness, and historical vulnerability, generating a Resilience Score with actionable insights. Its Explainable AI (XAI) builds trust by delivering transparent justifications, while blockchain ensures tamper-proof accountability. Multilingual, voice-enabled chatbots guarantee inclusivity across diverse populations.

Key Features & Innovation :
Resilience Analyzer – readiness evaluation of hospitals, shelters, power, water, drills, resources, routes, and historical impact (can be used for Country ,State ,District, City ,Locality,Ward etc)

Explainable AI (XAI) – transparent reasoning for alerts.

Blockchain Records – immutable disaster logs.

Advanced Data Integration – data fusion, quantum simulations, live weather feeds, RAG-powered LLMs for real-time policy/news.

Inclusive Accessibility – multilingual, gender-neutral NLP, federated verification.

Policy Integration – citizen input → AI-analyzed feedback loops for adaptive policies.

Technology Stack :
Frontend: React.js + Next.js + Tailwind CSS

Backend: Python + FastAPI + NumPy + Pydantic

Blockchain: Hyperledger for tamper-proof records

Weather APIs: OpenWeatherMap integration

AI/LLM: IBM Granite LLM + RAG for context-aware alerts

Quantum Optimization: QAOA-inspired simulations

System Workflow :
